          I’ve been involved in a number of local amateur groups in Frome and
          Castle Cary over the past few years, taking both ensemble and lead
          parts. If it involves any combination of acting, singing or dancing,
          I’m up for it. 2024 will also see my debut as a Musical Director.

          I primarily enjoy listening to jazz and contemporary Christian
          worship, but also occasionally classical music. I play guitar, bass,
          cello, piano, and can have a fair bash at clarinet, saxophone, drums,
          and melodica. Oh, and I also write music too.

          I’m now two years into my rebuild project, constructing a OO scale
          fictitious GWR branch line terminus set in the late 1930s,
          affectionately called “Frontington and Backwoods”. I have documented
          my progress through

          I’m a licensed Reader in the Church of England, ministering to my
          local church and community. I also lead worship at a local ecumenical
          gathering called The Filling Station.
